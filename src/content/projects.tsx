          I currently work at Gamma. Being early means I've gotten to work on an
          ungodly amount of the productâ€”AI, core product, onboarding,
          monetization, B2Bâ€”across multiple disciplines: research, design,
          product strategy, and even eng work. I've built the role I want.

          Gamma lets you write content like a document and present it like a
          deck. Think: "Notion on crack" (actual customer quote) but for
          presentations, and increasingly other media.

          I love camping and backpacking. In fall of 2020 I went looking for a
          good, mobile-optimized camping checklist. The options in the App Store
          were disappointing and I figured I could make something better.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          It took 7 months of free timeâ€”but after many late nights interviewing
          friends, designing, prototyping, and watching SwifttUI + Realm DB
          tutorialsâ€”I shipped an app. "Camping Checklist - Pro" has been
          downloaded by folks all over the world. Primarily the US, Canada, UK,
          Australia and Germany.
