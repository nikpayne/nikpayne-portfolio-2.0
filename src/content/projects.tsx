          Gamma lets you write content like a document and present it like a

          presentations, and increasingly other media.

          I love camping and backpacking. In fall of 2020 I went looking for a
          good, mobile-optimized camping checklist. The options in the App Store
          were disappointing and I figured I could make something better.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          It took 7 months of free timeâ€”but after many late nights interviewing
          friends, designing, prototyping, and watching SwifttUI + Realm DB
          tutorialsâ€”I shipped an app. "Camping Checklist - Pro" has been
          downloaded by folks all over the world. Primarily the US, Canada, UK,
          Australia and Germany.
