          I love camping and backpacking. In fall of 2020 I went looking for a
          good, mobile-optimized camping checklist. The options in the App Store
          were disappointing and I figured I could make something better.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          It took 7 months of free timeâ€”but after laterâ€”of interviewing friends,
          designing, prototyping, and watching SwitftUI + Realm DBâ€”I shipped an
          app. "Camping Checklist - Pro" has had been downloaded by folks all
          over the world. Primarily the US, Canada, UK, Australia and Germany.
